How To Play
===========
You are a next evolution in the human species and you have developed psychic powers which allow you to use telekinesis and create constructs of psychic energy. You have
been captured by scientists for experimentation and your task in this game is to escape the facility without dying. Security have taken measures to prevent your escape,
putting obstacles and soldiers in your way. Along the path you may find syringes with experiemntal concoctions inside which may inhance your abilities, increasing your
chance of survival. Will you escape or will they kill you first?

Pressing 'I' in game in the Overworld or in level, then accessing the 'How to Play' tab there will broadly provide the same information, though the font used here may be easier to read.

Overworld
---------
This area is the first area you encounter once you have pressed play on the main menu. It is the level selection area, providing a large scale map of the entire facility
that the player must traverse in order to escape. Padlocks, present on the map act as interfaces for acessing new levels. They appear unlocked if the player cna go into 
the level and locked if they cannot.

Padlocks in the main corridor connect to standard levels which take place in a 3D enviornment where the player must overcome obstacles wihtout dying. Packlocks found in
side corriders unlock a bonus interaction where the player interacts with a special kind of medical box with three compartments. These boxes essentially posit the player 
with the monty hall problem and provide an additional method for the player to acquire a random powerup. One of these bonus levels unlocks each time the player completes
a regular level. Unlike regular levels, these cannot be replayed, so the player cannot farm them inifitely for powerups like the regular levels.

### Controls
- "Horizontal Axis" ('A' and 'D' by default) for moving the player left and right
- "Vertical Axis" ('W' and 'S' by default) for moving the player up and down
- "Interact" ('F' by default) for entering levels when standing next to them
- "Menu" ('I' by default) for opening the menu to access settings, get information or quit

Levels
------
In order to successfully complete a level, a player must touch the black exit door at the end of the level without dying. The player is permitted to restart the level on 
death and they may do this as many times as they wish. Any powerups obtained over the course of the level, however, are removed on restart of the level.

### The player
The player's primary method of attacking is through balistic projectiles made of psychic energy. These pink balls are emitted from the player in a straight line directly 
forward for a short distance and will explode on impact with anything other than a psychic box. This method of attack is known as 'Magic mode'. The player can switch to 
'Sword Mode' which is an alternative attacking mode wwith a shorter range and lower fire rate than 'Magic mode' but it deals much more damage. In sword mode, the player 
conjures a swordmade of psychic energy which they swing as they 'Left Click'. This special sword is the only thing that can destory psychic boxes found throughout the levels.

Due to the player's psychic abilities they can reduce the affect of gravity on themselves by holding 'Space' while falling, allowing them to avoid fall damage as 
well as float over various obstacles.

The first of the player's two special psychic abilites is a psychic vine abilty. When 'Q' is pressed while looking at a valid surface the player conjures a pink vine which
pulls them towards that surface. The croshair in the middle of the screen denotes if this ability can be used at a given time based on if it is 2 green arrows or a red cross.
When the crosshair is two green arrows the player may press 'Q' to execute the ability. The red cross will appear if the player is looking at an invalid surface (e.g:
a psychic box), the nearest solid object the player is looking at is too far away or if the abiltiy is on cooldown.

The second and final of the player's special psychic abilities is a levitate ability. When 'E' is pressed while looking at a valid enemy, that enemy is hurled straight upwards into
the air. When they land on the ground they take fall damage. If a Pink-Purple circular aura appears around an enemy it means that they are eligible to be launched into the air by 
this ability. The aura doesn't show up if the enemy is out of range or if the ability is on cooldown.Human enemies are considered valid for this ability, while robot enemies are not.

### The Environment
Levels are filled with pink boxes with line patterns throughout them, these are special psychic boxes which can be only destoryed by the player's sword. The boxes are usually placed
to either provide an obstacle (e.g: blocking off a room to impede the player's progression), obscure a powerup, or provide an alternative path to a slower or more dangerous route. The
player's magic attacks pass striaght through these boxes and so they may be used to provide cover while attack an enemy.

Levels also contain Electrified walls and Acid pools. These environmental hazards deal damage to the player or enemies that come into contact with them and should be avoided as much 
as possible.

Starting in level two, some areas have ice on the floor. While this obstacle doesn't deal damage, the slipperiness of the surface can often cause the player to slide into danger if 
they are not careful.

### Enemies
Enemies have a vision radius within which they can see the player. Once the player enters this radius, they will move towards the player. If they are within stopping distance
of the player they turn to face the player and start shooting, with the aim of killing the player.

Enemies have two hitboxes, one for their head and one for the rest of their body. If an attack of any kind from the player hits the enemy's head it deals an additional 50%
damage and a small 'boom' particle effect is emitted.
