Gaming-Technologies-and-Simulations-Coursework
==============================================

This work-in-progress game is a unity project, created for my coursework submission for the Gaming Technologies and Simulations module.

My game is 3D game which draws influence from FPSs and Platformers. The Overworld element of my game is an interactive level selection screen which is 2D.

How to Use
-------------

To run the game open the scene called "Main Menu" and press play in the editor. If launched form another scene, the game should automatically transfer to the main menu however this hasn't be tested withg all scenes. Alternatively there is a build of the game found in the /Build folder, though the UI doesn't always scale correctly when viewing the game through this method.

The game contains 5 levels. On completion of the fifth level there is nothing else to complete in the game.

For information on controls either press 'I' once inside the game or see [HOWTOPLAY.md](HOWTOPLAY.md)
